# Nginx Setup

This repo is an example of how to setup Nginx on a VPS like [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) or [SSDNodes](https://www.ssdnodes.com/).

I dislike doing this manually so use these packages which help with regularization and automation.

To do this I'm using [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy) and [docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion) together.
